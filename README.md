# pymine

A package that takes a list of URLs and creates a dataframe ufor machine learning projects using  BOW

## why `pymine`
There are some libraries and packages that can really facilitate this job, from scraping text from a URL to returning it to a bag of words (BOW). However, to the extent of our knowledge, there is no sufficiently handy and straightforward package for this purpose. As a good example, `BeautifulSoup` widely used to pull different sources of data from HTML and XML pages does not have a package that returns a BOW, which is extensively employed in machine learning projects.

### NOTE:
Some websites do not let users collect their data with web scraping tools. Make sure that your target websites do not refuse your request to collect data before applying this package. 

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install pymine
